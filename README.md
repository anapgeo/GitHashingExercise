# GitHashingExercise

In this project, i created a shell script that takes as input a 4-digit number, produces the hash value of this input and saves the output to a txt file. I use the SHA-256 hash algorithm.

## Usage:

- Make the script executable : ``chmod +x hash_script``
- Run the script with a four-digit number as input: ``./hash_script 1234``
- The output will be saved in hash_output.txt. To view the file, use: ``cat hash_output.txt``
